This repository contains the complete design set for the Bank Account Management System web application.
All the UI/UX pages were created in Figma based on my ideas, with support from Builder.io AI during the design process.

These designs represent the structure, layout, and overall flow of the application’s frontend.
I’ll continue updating the files as the project moves forward.

Feel free to review the designs and share any suggestions to improve the UI or user experience.

Thanks for checking it out!
